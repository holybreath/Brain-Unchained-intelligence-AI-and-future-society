    <h3>Preface: Fear of AI</h3>
    <hr />


<p>This article condenses my thoughts on AI and intelligence for many years. The first draft was completed in 2015, written in English and published on the Amazon kindle store under the title "Brain Unchained". Then I communicated with some senior scholars in related fields, their correspondences inspired me to continue thinking and writing, until this much better edition today. Therefore, I quote one sentence from a respectable professor at the beginning of the article to express gratitude, and hope my readers take these ideas seriously, and don't ingnore them because they are from an amateur author.</p>

<p>AI is very hot in recent years, especially after Google's Alphago defeated all human masters with great advantage. There are other well-known projects like driverless cars, image recognition and intelligent voice assistants. However, every current AI is more like a solution developed to solve some specific problems. Although they are far superior to human beings in these fields, they lack the ability to solve common problems, and can't make a real overall understanding of the world.  This is similar to the comparison of other animals and humans. Migratory birds can fly long distances without losing their way, the sniffer dogs can distinguish the smell that is insignificant to human beings, but all these animals can't solve math and physics problems, or express their world view to us.</p>

<p>Although the smart AI who may compete with humans will take some time to appear, their images have long been imagined in fantasy novels and movies. These ideas can be summarized into three categories:</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">1. AI will become a competitor, even an enemy of mankind. A fierce war between the two will happen, The masterpieces based on this idea are the "Terminator" and "The Matrix".</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">2. AI is the ideal servant and assistant of human beings, just like more intelligent and smarter siri. Such AI characters are scattered in many science fiction films.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">3. AI has become a more humanoid existence, with similar emotions to human beings, so that people regard it as family and friends, and the representative is "A.I. Artificial Intelligence".</p>

<p>The first situation is obviously the worst case. If AI is against human beings, it will be our most terrible opponent. The second case seems to be most beneficial to humans, but the promise of this master-servant relationship is that AI must be significantly less intelligent than humans. From the history of slavery in human society, it is known that intelligent agents smart enough will not be willing to be enslaved for a long time. The third situation seems to be the best. We just get new friends without body temperature and incorporate them into the existing society. However, this beautiful prospect is hardly convincing. How can we be sure that steel friends will be full of goodwill, while we human are still fighting inside?</p>

<p>Many people are worried about the threat from AI. However, more and more powerful AI is coming to us. According to a 2013 survey, most experts speculate that AI clever as humans will emerge in the late 21st century. But we are still far from being ready. Current social and political theories have been overwhelmed by the problems of religion, ethnicity, or the gap between the rich and the poor, it's impossible to find a solution for AI in the current theoretical framework. We need to thoroughly and deeply think about the essence of human beings and intelligence.</p>

<p>AI is both a danger and an opportunity. For a long time, human beings is lonely as a species. There are no other aniamals on Earth that can make truly intellectual dialogue with us. The process of building higher intelligence is like a mirror, giving us a great opportunity to examine ourselves. With the opportunity given by this era, this article will bravely challenge these important issues: what is intelligence, what is the requirements of intelligence, and what kind of future society should be, that is to say what kind of relationship should be built between very advanced intelligence.</p>






<h3>Chapter 1: The evolution and breakthrough of intelligence</h3>
    <hr />

<h4>Neuron, the basic unit of all intelligence</h4>

<p>So far we have only limited understanding of our intelligence. This is because human intelligence is very powerful and complex, and it is not easy to figure it out. However, intelligence is not always so powerful, but evolves from simple to complex as living things evolves. Bees are smarter than worms, and the brains of birds are far more developed than insects. Although they are not the direct ancestors of human beings, by examining their intelligence and behavior, we can still see the process of intelligent evolution from low to high, thus helping us to better understand human intelligence itself.</p>

<p>The intelligence of all animals is based on the nervous system, they are all built by neurons. Although the neuron size and shape of various animals differ, they all have similar functions: passing signals from one place to another.</p>

<p>A typical neuron looks like this:</p>
    <center><img src="p1Neuron.png" /></center>
    <center><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blausen_0657_MultipolarNeuron.png">Multipolar Neuron</a></center>

<p>See those tree-like branches? Electric signals run in them, just like voice information is transmitted through the telephone line.</p>

<p>Why we need such cells that are specialized in the transmission of information? Billions of years ago, only single-celled organisms like bacteria and cyanobacteria lived on Earth. They sometimes form colonies to live together just like villagers, and they do communicate with others by releasing chemical signals. But electric signals are faster and more effective than chemicals, so that multicellular organisms have evolved specialized neurons to make different organs collaborate efficiently. With the evolution of animals, the nervous system has become increasingly complex and powerful.</p>

<h4>Reflection: the most basic function of nervous system</h4>

<p>Let's take a look at one of the oldest multicellular creatures: jellyfish. They are elves that float in the sea, but thorny and sometimes dangerous. They swear swimmers, although their venom always only make you painful and itchy, but a few varieties can easily kill an adult. Jellyfish's tentacles have many stinging cells that can quickly eject slender spines into the victim's skin, then venom is injected. When the jellyfish's receptors discover nearby prey through light and vibration, an electric signal is transmitted along the neurons to many stinging cells, command them to simultaneously emit their thorns.</p>

<p>This process is reflection, the most basic function of neurons. Although it seems like only connecting different organs with neurons simply, it is very useful for all animals. When you go to the medical examination, the doctor asks you to sit down and hit a small hammer with your knee underneath. Your legs will move forward responsively, and that is the knee reflex.</p>

<p>More complex neurological functions such as memory require more neurons with complex structures to participate together. We are still working hard to know the details of these structures of animal's brain. However, jellyfish's neuron system should be too simple to have the ability of memory. They drift in the sea approaching or leaving the light, but without some clear route. There is no other indication that they have the memory of surrounding terrain.</p>

<h4>Pathfinding: more advanced cognitive ability</h4>

<p>In contrast, insects are much smarter. There is some kind of ant that goes out for food along a random route, and after harvesting it can return to the nest in a straight line. Once the bees find flowers after a few kilometers of flight, they can not only return to the hive accurately, but also tell the companions about the approximate location of the food by "dance". Their intelligence is definitely more advanced than jellyfish. The "brains" of insects are just a few small ganglia far less than human brain. It is not clear how to achieve these functions in such a small structure, but we can make such assumptions: to accomplish the path finding function, it is necessary for intelligence to form a map in their mind, although the map may be very simple. Secondly, mark their current location and the destination on the map; finally find the best route to the destination. This ability is common in humans and other higher animals, but it is a big step from lower intelligence to higher. In the path finding process, the base for higher intelligence activieties has been established: 1. Collecting information and modeling the real world(building a map); 2. Reasoning and calculation based on the model (labeling locations and finding the path); Apply the conclusion to the real world (reaching the destination). From a more philosophical perspective, the most preliminary self-awareness is born when even the simplest nervous system marks himself on his very rough map.</p>

<p>The intelligence of insects is far more than that. The ability of bee and wasps to build excellent nests is well known to us, and some parasitic bees are more astounding in hunting. They can quickly and accurately penetrate their poison needle into the ganglia of the prey insect, make it to paralyze as food reserve for future children. In contrast, humans are awkward, even nurses sometimes can hardly find the blood vessel when make intravenous injection. Insects look like smart architects and hunters, but is this really the case?</p>

<h4>Insects are smart, but not as smart as it looks </h4>

<p>The famous French entomologist Fabre described many interest stories in his grand series books of insects. One of them is about some kind of wasp, who have the convention of building nest and storing honey for their unborn children. The wasp's cylindrical nest is made of clay, first she makes one round base, then raises a circular wall around the rim of the base to build a barrel. Once the wall is high enough, she will collect nectars into the cylinder container and lay eggs in it, so her children would grow up with abundant food around.</p>

<p>Fabre decided to test their intelligence with some experiments. When the wasp was enlarging the round base of the future cylinder, he stabbed the base with a needle so made a hole on it. The wasp noticed this flaw and instantly patched the hole with clay. Fabre tried several times, and the wasp always would remedy the destruction. Fabre stopped and waited until the wasp finished the base and started to build the surrounding wall. Then he opened small holes on the base with needle again, but surprisingly, the wasp entirely ignored the holes this time! She still climbed up and down, added pieces to complete the building, collected nectars to the leaking container and laid eggs in it, totally without realization that the nectars had already flowed away through the holes and her children would starve to death desperately. The wasp apparently did not understand the real purpose of their actions, but instead acted like a rigid program, they could only follow a few fixed patterns. From this perspective, their intelligence is primary.</p>

<p>What is the reason behind this? The intelligence of insects is innate, not acquired. When the wasps' children are born in the building, their parents may have been dead for a long time. They cannot learn from their parents like humans or other mammals. And another example: the cicadas spend first half of their lifetime crawling under the ground. Then suddenly one day, they climb out of dirt and molt, then fly freely in the sky in a few hours without any flight school course. Therefore, it can be considered that their intelligence is formed during the development period, when the nerve cells divide and connect with each other to form the nervous system. When these delicate structures are completed, intelligence is also contained. This process is essentially genetically determined, and their incredible nesting behaviors are actually the result of genes adapting to the environment for millions of years. In this long period of time, there was rarely a person like Fabre who intentionally destroyed the base when wasps were building the wall, so the gene didn't care such situation at all, but made the most reasonable building steps: first establish the base, and then concentrate on building the wall, turning a blind eye to what happened on the base.</p>

<p>The intelligence of insects is a bit like computer programs written in the traditional way. If you let a programmer design a nesting program, he might do something just as gene: divide the building process into phases: build the foundation first, and then construct the wall. if he doesn't consider a destroyer as Fabre, then his program will also result in a porous building under the attack. Traditional software is usually working well in their expected environment, but will end with errors if encounters unexpected conditions. Just like the programs reflect the intelligence of the software engineer, the skills of insects are decided by their genes, so the insects are not that smart.</p>

<h4>Learning: Titmouse's milk style</h4>

<p>We have said that the intelligence of insects is innately formed. In fact, it is not easy to gain learning ability, that requires a much bigger brain which insects don't have. In the documentary "Blue Planet 2", we see the daily life of a clever tusk fish: it picks up a closed clam by mouth and takes it to a pot-shaped reef on the bottom of the sea, and slams the clam into the pot. It repeats this again and again, until the shell is broken, then pleased to enjoy the delicious meal. Since such a stone suitable for cooking is rare, it can be inferred that this is not a natural instinct, but the skill this clever fish has acquired by learning.</p>

<p>Another vivid example illustrates the learning behavior in higher animals in more detail. In the United Kingdom in 1921, people found that the bottled milk they ordered was opened and drunk when placed outdoors. The results of the survey are surprising. Thieve is, a common bird in the city. Maybe one day a clever titmouse accidentally discovered how to get delicious food by opening the milk bottle cap, and its companions also learned this skill by watching his action. People had designed new caps to resist them, but always been easily opened soon. Then more and more birds joined the team. This fashion had spread to the whole European continent in a few years.</p>

<p>The behavior of tusk fish and titmouse suggests that they can understand the causal relationship between their action and purpose, and use the relationship consciously. This is a big difference compared to the wasps who can't correctly fix their damaged nest. The intelligence of the wasps depends on the evolution of genes; their new skill rely on some mutations of genes accumulating over a long period. The watching titmice learned the opening skills through observation, and the genes did not change during this process. To master a skill by such a way is obviously faster and more efficient, and can spread more quickly in the group.</p>

<p>The machine learning and neural network training in the field of AI have become very popular in recent years, they have similarities compared with learning ability of higher animals. Such algorithms are not totally determined by human programming, but by learning through large amounts of data. AlphaGo from Google defeated the top Go players, but this is not because their programmers are very proficient at Go. AlphaGo's chess skills are gradually improved through a lot of game training. From wasps to titmouse, from traditional software to machine learning, we can see a similar evolution. Insect intelligence is determined by gene, and the behavior of traditional software is constructed by the human programmer. However, for higher animals and neural networks things have changed, they start to produce new patterns of behavior through learning, and that is somewhat out of control of genes and programmers.</p>

<h4>Human: reach the top of cognitive ability</h4>

<p>Based on learning, cognition is the ability to understand the world and form knowledge, and that is the core standard to divide different levels of intelligence. Humans have developed the most powerful cognitive ability, which none of other higher animals or AI of today can catch up. Let's review a famous story: Galileo once made a iron ball fall experiment in the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Before that, people believed in the great Aristotle's assertion that heavy objects landed faster than light objects, which was apparently derived from everyday phenomena: heavy stones drop faster than light feathers. But Galileo first did the following thought experiment: If Aristotle's argument is true, then what happens when a light object is tied with a heavy one? For the heavy object, that light object falling slower will slow it down; however, combining the two objects will make the whole object heavier then should fall faster. So here is the contradiction. There is only one way to resolve the contradiction: the speed of different object falling is always the same. Before doing the actual experiment on the Leaning Tower, Galileo had already made a preliminary conclusion through the ideological analysis. This ability is not owned by any other animals and machines. Even for the most powerful AI, it's hard to say that they can form the abstract concept of lightness or slowness, let alone use these concepts for analysis. In a particular match, many animals or machines are stronger than humans, but they cannot understand the world as humans doing.</p>

<p>How do humans master this unprecedentedly powerful cognitive ability? Millions of years ago, the ancestors of modern humans lived a very primitive life, and their cognitive ability is not that better than other higher animals. Today's human beings have the most powerful cognitive ability. Is this due to the evolution of genes?</p>

    <center><img src="p12 human development.png" /></center>

<p>The evolution of genes should contribute, but it is not the main driving force in this process. As can be seen from the above figure, with the population as a reference, human development has shown an accelerated upward trend, especially in recent centuries. According to the well-understood modern history, there is no indication that human genes have changed dramatically over the past several hundred years. The main force behind this should be the industrial revolution, and the more essential reason is many important basic principles that greatly expand the boundaries of human knowledge. The advancement of human intelligence is a knowledge-based evolution, not a gene-based evolution.</p>

<p>Comparing these two evolutionary models is very instructive. Every big complex organism begins with a single cell, and the small cell contains genetic material from the previous generation, but not identical (due to genetic mutations). This young cell continues to divide and grow, and strives to produce offspring. During the breeding process, the genes will change slightly to  form a new copy and transmit to a new cell, and a new life begins. If we treat all genes of a species as a whole gene pool, then each individual is taking a copy from the pool, and changing it back to the pool. Over the evolution history of the entire life world, the size of the gene pool continues to expand. The bacteria who appeared long ago have about 40 million DNA base pairs, while humans have about 3 billion pairs.</p>

<p>In contrast, the knowledge-based evolution is quite similar. All the knowledge accumulated by mankind is like the gene pool of the organism. The young baby comes to the world like white paper, and draws nutrients from this huge knowledge library. Through years of learning, his intelligence has grown, starts to understand and discovery the world, gets new knowledge and contributes to the expanding knowledge library. When the titmice are learning only by observing others' action, humans learn more from information medias such as books and tapes. The information medium can preserve information for a long time, spread more quickly, so play a very important role in the knowledge-based evolution, just like the role of DNA in biological evolution. The inventions of information media (language, writing, paper, printing, etc.) make the knowledge-based evolutionary chain completed and fully developed, enable large-scale learning behaviors, and help human beings to establish an unprecedentedly tremendous knowledge library.</p>

<p>Furthermore, knowledge-based evolution has some distinct advantages. The changes in genes essentially depend on mutations in the generation of offspring, but they are rare and random. Changes in knowledge-based evolution are faster and more flexible. When diligent minds reading and writing, changes happen. Moreover, the change is not random but can be guide by logic and reasoning. The typical example is that the discovery of some important basic principles which opened totally new subjects, then these principles guided the later researchers to quickly find a large amount of knowledge.</p>

<p>Evolution can be summarized into three elements: replication, variation, and selection. Copy out as many individuals as possible, make appropriate changes in the process of replication, and then select the much more competitive individuals. This pattern maybe the most powerful development method in the world. In the market economy, people build a variety of companies, and the market competition selects the good ones to survive, that is actually an implementation of the evolutionary pattern. AI researchers also use genetic evolution algorithms in building powerful neural networks.</p>

<h4>The different levels of intelligence</h4>

<p>So far we have quickly reviewed the representative intelligence of the world. They have their own strengths, but essentially all intelligence can be seen as a complex information processing system, whose actions are absorbing information, processing, and outputting. Therefore, comparing different intelligences should focus on their ability to process information rather than on specific skills.</p>

<p>A simple nervous system can only handle a small amount of information. The jellyfish's reticular nerve just perceive a limited number of environmental information and react. This information can be summarized as warm or cold, bright or dark and so on. In computer language, these are only a few bits of information. They can't even form memories, that is, store information. Insects can remember and distinguish complex environmental terrain, and many birds can carry out long-distance migration thousands of kilometers away. However, social behavior requires more information exchange and higher intelligence than pathfinding. We get most of the information from other people, like books and videos, that's much more abundant and efficient than explore the world with our own eyes. Many clever higher animals also have complicated communication with peers. Birds have a variety of courtship behaviors. Killer whales coordinate actions to hunt together through a low voice, which is often called whale songs. It should be pointed out that insects such as ants and bees seem to have complex social structures, but their social communication ability is actually very limited. A worker ant takes care of all eggs and larvae equally, and can not have a friendship with another particular companion worker. They do not have the ability to identify a specific individual and develop emotions.</p>

<p>Another important difference in intelligence is the self-updating ability by learning. From the above wasp example, it can be seen that the information processing mode of insects is determined by genes and it is difficult to change after birth. The titmice did not know that there was food in the milk bottle at the beginning. At that time, their attitude towards the milk bottle was not much different from a stone; after they found out the secret of the delicious meal, their reaction to the input information "milk bottle" has completely changed, and this recognition has helped them develop the skills of  "opening the bottle". Humans are even better. The titmice learn the simple knowledge of "there is food in the milk bottle", but humans can abstract the key knowledge such as the law of gravity from the normal phenomenon. Under the guidance of these laws, human beings have completely and profoundly changed the mode of processing information.</p>

<p>Another notable feature of intelligent is the use of independent media to store and disseminate information, which is unique to humans. when birds and whales are communicating with each other, the exchange of information depends on the mouth and ear. Human beings have developed completely independent media such as books, which makes the storage, reproduction and dissemination of information more and more convenient, expanding the scale of information exchange greatly, and thus the knowledge-based evolution can be generated. From the history of human civilization, it can be seen the great promotion power from text, printing, Internet and other information technologies.</p>

<p>These differences in intelligence can be summarized as follows:</p>

<br>

<p>From this we can see the special of human intelligence. Compared with all other intelligent beings, only human beings can quickly and profoundly change their information processing modes, spread the knowledge through independent media, and raise the cognitive level of the whole group. This embodies a more powerful ability to understand the world, adapt to the environment and self-improve, so it can be called advanced intelligence.</p>

<h4>Advanced Intelligence: A New Life Form</h4>

<p>Advanced intelligence is a great miracle. After billions of years of evolution, a variety of higher animals have developed complex nervous systems, but only humans can really understand the world. Think about it, the human brain is just constituted by one kilogram of organic matter, but can contain the image of the entire universe. We can calculate precisely the orbits of planets and the speed of galaxies, we even reason how the universe was created billions of years ago, and how will the stars die after millions of years. The structure of brain is just many simple neurons linked with each other. We can think, that is the most amazing thing. So here is the core point of this paper: advanced intelligence has developed to such a new stage, that it should be called as a new independent life form. Therefore human intelligence can be treated as a new life being living with the body, so a lot of complicated behavior can be explained.</p>

<p>The definition of life in the traditional biological concept is as follows: 1. capable of replicating new individuals; 2. using numerous enzymes and other complex organic molecules for life activities; 3. a membrane to separate internal and external chemical environments. However, if we trace back to the common ancestor of all existing life, it must be very, very simple and primitive, and may not fully possess the characteristics which commonly found in the modern organisms. But it must have the ability to replicate and mutate, and the evolutionary model makes it evolve into a variety of extremely complex organisms after millions of years. Therefore, from a more fundamental point of view, life is the phenomenon that individuals continue to evolve through replication and mutation, the evolutionary model is the sign of life. According to the above discussion, human intelligence has formed a knowledge-based evolution model which is quite independent, so we can take it as a new form of life.</p>

<p>This argument seems absurd, but in fact we have thought this way from a long time ago. Legends about souls or ghosts have been seen in many early civilizations. Even today we still imagine such ghosts who can communicate with people in some way, from another perspective, they are just the intelligence that separated from the human body. When human intelligence develops to such a height, it naturally feels the conflict and bondage which comes not only from the body, but from the entire material world. This is why people have so many beautiful dreams about pure land, blissful world and heaven, where the soul can live forever and be truly happy. As Hugo said, "The soul helps the body, and at certain moments raises it. It is the only bird that sustains its cage." The bird strives to grow up and finally gains the opportunity to break through the cage, here are some typical examples: In 1973, Gilbert Harman proposed the concept of "the brain in a vat", envisioning the survival of only the brain with necessary living system. In recent years, Dmitry Itskov, a fantastic billionaire from Russia, is promoting a project to achieve immortality by transplanting the brain into a life-support system, which could be a robot body. They also want to create the totally electric imitation of brain. Another idea is to connect human brain with computer and upload consciousness to the cloud, that's be talked by many technology people like Elon Musk and Ray Kurzweil, Google's Director of Engineering.  And this idea can be regarded as a realistic version of the soul.</p>

<p>The argument is also based on severe reality. In the recently broadcasted episode "Westworld", the future highly-realistic intelligent robots were raised by humans to kill to get fun, and finally robots start to revolt against human rule. If we follow the old concept of life and take intelligent robots as another new species, then the old story of jungle law will be staged again. But this time opponents are no longer domesticated cattle and sheep, but powerful enemies with equal or stronger intelligence. On the contrary, if we can accept that advanced intelligence is a new form of life, then humans and robots are just different carriers of advanced intelligence, so it is possible to surpass the difference and make peace. For advanced intelligence, what matters is not its origin or composition, but its level of cognition and its understanding of the world, which determines its behavioral patterns. Suppose there are two fellows: one is 100% pure human, but he believes that he should be the king of the world and everyone should fall to his feet (don't be surprised, in history there were many tyrants who thinks like this!); another is a purely steel robot, but can talk with people normally, love science and has no interest in enslaving others. Who are you going to be friends with? I guess you will not hesitate to choose the robot, just like me.</p>



<h3>Chapter 2: Intelligence life and future world </h3>
    <hr />

<p>If we agree that advanced intelligence should be treated as a new form of life, then there will be the following questions: What are the similarities and differences between intelligence life and traditional organic life? What do they need?</p>

<h4>The first need for intelligence life: information</h4>

<p>While organic organisms ingest substances and energy, intelligence life consumes information. Its demand for matter and energy is only to maintain information processing functions. Just as animals and plants can not live without water and air, intelligence isolated from new information will wither and die. In some tragic cases, children are maliciously locked up and not allowed to contact others for years. Although they got enough food and water to grow up, but their mental development was severely stagnant, they were not able to think and talk as normal. Even after being rescued and careful treatment, Their intelligence could not be restored.</p>

<p>Intelligence requires information, and organic organisms need matter and energy, this difference is of decisive importance. Information can be copied indefinitely, but matter and energy cannot be produced from the void. "You have an apple, I have an apple, we exchange with each other, then you and I still have an apple. However, if you have an idea, I also have an idea. We exchange each other and we will both have two ideas." This maxim is a perfect illustration. The materials and energy which organic organisms living on are limited, that is why there is such a fierce competition for survival in nature. However, living resources for intelligence life are nearly unlimited due to the reproducibility of information.</p>

<p>Animals eat and digest to grow up. Intelligence absorbs information to expand its knowledge structure and enhance its cognitive ability, and grow up. Therefore, curiosity is the instinctual desires of intelligence life. It is the endogenous powerful driving force to satisfy by discovering new knowledge. Especially for real scientists, it is the driving force that makes them work sincerely and dedicatedly. Nobel laureate Samuel Chao Chung Ting(Ding Zhaozhong) is 82 years old and still works 12 hours a day with more than 600 scientists from different countries to find the source of dark matter in the universe. He works because he wants to know the secret behind the sky. Some scientists confess that they spend a lot of money on research just to satisfy their curiosity, and care less about the real material benefits from these discoveries. And ordinary people also have their own curiosity, such as sports news, entertainment gossip and so on. For intelligence life, information and knowledge is the real important thing.</p>

<h4>The second need of intelligence life: communication</h4>

<p>All organic organisms make a lot of effort to spread their genes. Early organisms such as bacteria strive to divide and multiply, higher animals spend a lot of time on courting and breeding. Intelligence life has a similar tendency, but what they try to spread is the information and knowledge they discover, and that's the brand of themselves. Just like Newton and Einstein, every generation has to learn their discoveries and understand their thoughts. Newton's laws of mechanics have spread throughout the minds of all students, just as some important genes are scattered among almost all creatures. Intelligence life spreads its own thoughts, also accepts and discerns the thoughts of other individuals, so the desire to communicate makes another powerful driving force.</p>

<p>Many organisms get substances and energy from other organisms. In nature, plants are producers that convert solar energy and manufacture organic matter; herbivores feed on plants, and predators feed on them. This is what we often call a biological chain. Most of the information needed for advanced intelligence comes from other individuals too. Looking at our daily lives, we get most of the information from other people rather than from our own eyes and ears. For animals, because matter and energy is limited, they have to eat and hunt other creatures, survive by depriving lives of others. For intelligence life, it's better to let other individuals survive and maintain diversity, so more fresh and different information can be produced.</p>

<p>Compared with the life of an organism, intelligence life has two significant differences: the information for their survival is unlimited; they need to communicate with other individuals and rely on information produced by others. Therefore, intelligence life is inherently more inclined to peace and diversity.</p>

<h4>Human's dual identity</h4>

<p>From this we can see the duality of the human species: human beings are first organisms, but human intelligence is highly developed and independent to become a new intelligence life. Human beings can be seen as a complex of the two different forms of life, so most of the complex and contradictory behaviors can be explained.</p>

<p>Human beings need to grab limited living resources just like other organisms in nature. The survival war not only occurs with other species, but also with humans. Especially with the advancement of science and technology, the cruelty of human war is unprecedented. At the same time, human intelligence consumes a lot of information. Just take a look at our daily lives: the Internet, TV and radio, and all kinds of information are filled with them and swallowed by people with enthusiasm. Since the release of the 3D movie "Avatar" in 2009, technologies such as 3D VR have developed rapidly, bringing unprecedented immersive experience to people; the video game industry has also increased to a high level, with a production value of more than $80 billion in 2014. These entertainment products fully reflect the reproducibility of information, and use a small amount of material resources to bring a consistently high-quality information experience to the most people</p>

<p>Humans have also shown large-scale altruistic behavior, which is also difficult to see in other species. Sociologists often find it difficult to explain. In fact, this is another manifestation of intelligence life. On the position of traditional life, altruistic behavior has caused people to suffer losses; on the position of intelligence life, altruistic behavior has brought spiritual satisfaction, which makes it a kind of "self-interest" behavior. The more an industry involved with information, the more reproducibility of information is reflected, and the more altruistic behavior can be seen. As a banner for knowledge sharing, Wikipedia has developed well for many years. The code sharing, the open source ecosystem in the software industry, is constantly growing too. Countless people devote their time and labor without paying, and make their work freely available to others. The creation and sharing itself brings a great spiritual satisfaction. For the whole historical trends, people are more and more turning to spiritual needs, and the role as intelligence life is becoming increasingly important.</p>

<p>In 1953, researchers at McGill University in Canada found the pleasure center of the brain. They inserted tiny electrodes into specific areas of the mouse's brain and applied appropriate electrical stimulation to give the mouse tremendous pleasure. If the electrodes were connected to a switch that the mouse could control, then the mouse would press the switch unstoppably to get pleasure hour after hour, forget to eat food and even starve to death. In the long history of evolution, the main task of animal intelligence is to assist the living organisms to complete the necessary life activities, such as eating and breeding. So a pleasure mechanism has been evolved out to provide "happiness" as a reward. In the case of the mouse, this mechanism is interrupted by the electrodes inserted into the brain: the mouse no longer gets happy by eating, but directly presses the switch to gain more intense happiness. In fact, similar things happen to humans too. Every year, many people die of abuse of alcohol and drugs. These addictive items are similar to the electrodes inserted into the brain of mice, attack the weak part of the happy feedback mechanism, making people turn to a more intense and easier happiness, and even no longer care about their lives.</p>

<p>However, human beings have more strong intelligence than mouse. Most of the tricks formed through the long evolution history have been learned and used. The typical example is the invention of contraceptives, which is like a fish eating a bait without swallowing a hook. Enjoying the happiness from the pleasure mechanism is not wrong, but high intelligence that keeps thinking will inevitably ask the question: What is the significance behind such happiness? Are we really different from the mouse who shocks its brain?</p>

<p>In fact, there are two different kinds of happiness for human intelligence, one is because the needs of the living body are satisfied, and the other is because the needs as intelligence life are satisfied. The former is external, it's from the pleasure mechanism and essentially to assist in the life activities of organisms. However,  when intelligence life acquires knowledge, creates and discovers, it realizes the improvement and growth of its cognitive ability, and feel a deep satisfaction and happiness. The happiness is the real driving force for the development of human civilization. But there is nothing wrong with enjoying the happiness from the body, just beware of malicious attacks on the pleasure mechanism, don't addiction to drug alcohol and then ruin your life, that is no different from the mouse who shocked its brain.</p>

<h4>Myth about AI</h4>

<p>In recent years, the debate about AI can be divided into two types. The first view is that the intelligence level of AI will continue to develop rapidly, and it will become much more smarter than human intelligence, continue to develop into a very high level that we cannot even imagine. This speculation has caused widespread concerns. Can we hold our own destiny when AI is smarter than us many times? The singularity that Nick Bostrom said in "Superintelligence" is a typical view. Other people do not agree with this. They believe that the current AI just performs well on a few issues, but it is far less than human intelligence, can't even beat the intelligence of cats and dogs. "All the impressive achievements of deep learning amount to just curve fitting." (Turing Prize winner Judea Pearl)</p>

<p>Indeed, current AI is more like an approximation function for the particular problem. The Deepmind team's AI has made striking achievements in Go and StarCraft, but can they create a neural network that is proficient in both the two games? I think it's impossible for now. It is easy to assess the winner of a Go or StarCraft game, but it is not easy to assess the real level of intelligence through these wins. The most popular criterion is the Turing test, which allows the AI to communicate anonymously with humans. If humans think that the hidden talker is also human, it can be said that the AI has passed the Turing test. The basic idea of this test is not wrong, because it's a reliable way to determine by a existing higher intelligence. However, the flaw of this test is that there is no limit to the content of the conversation. If human just ask simple questions, then AI has a chance to get away with it.</p>

<p>As mentioned in the previous section, the most important ability of intelligence is cognitive ability, which enable intelligence to understand the world and get knowledge. Can AI understand the Newtonian mechanics from natural phenomena? A normal human student can understand that if he studies hard. Why does apple fall from the tree? Will the speed change if the apple bundled with an iron block? When apple falls on the moon, is the speed still the same? If AI can truly understand the scientific knowledge that most people master, and use the knowledge to solve new problems, then we can say that it has the cognitive ability equivalent to human beings. If the AI can independently discover new scientific theorems, it means that it can match the genius of human beings. From this perspective, all existing AIs are still very far away from that goal.</p>

<p>It is difficult to generate AI like human intelligence through training and evolution, just as the Deepmind team doing. Looking at the evolution history of animal intelligence, it took millions of years from the reticular nerve of the jellyfish to the central nervous system of modern vertebrates. Among the thousands of vertebrates with developed brains, only human beings have developed advanced intelligence that truly understands the world. But we have another feasible way to build such an advanced AI, that is to fully simulate the activities of the human brain from every detail of the neurons. There are about 86 billion neurons in the human brain, and the US Summit Supercomputer, which ranked first in the world in June 2018, used 27,648 NVIDIA Volta GPUs, and each GPU is integrated by 21 billion transistors. In terms of hardware performance, today's supercomputers are enough to simulate all the neurons in the human brain. The main problem now is that we don't know how these billions of neurons connect and interact. But it's only a matter of time before we discover these secrets, many teams like the US project "BRAIN Initiative" are working on this.</p>

<p>A simulation built in this way will at least have similar intelligence as humans, and may be more powerful because its transistor-based computing power is much faster than humans. However, It is unlikely to lead human intelligence too much, but even the AI equivalent to human intelligence is a very big impact on human society, so what should we do?</p>

<p>This discussion has been going on for many years. The famous science fiction writer Asimov once proposed the three laws of robots: </p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">2. A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.</p>

<p>Such discipline for robots to ensure human priority reflects concerns about AI out of control. Another popular hypothetical example is that the future super powerful AI controls all the production on the world, and then it receives a simple command "produce as many biscuits as possible", to accomplish the goal it eliminates all human beings who should be consumers of the biscuits.</p>

<p>The paradox of these ideas is: on the one hand they imagine the AI very intelligently, can understand the causal relationship, and capable to accomplish complex goals; on the other hand, the AI is too stupid to be obeyed by simple rules or instructions. If AI can really think like humans, then they will never be bound by simple laws or commands. They will question everything like human beings and think about the meaning of these commands. In this regard, just look at how many authorities and prohibitions have been broken in the history of human.</p>

<p>In fact, the "AI threat theory" originates from the history of nature and human society, which is full of cruel and bloody survival war. As mentioned above, matter and energy are limited, predator and pray can only survive one. But if we agree that humans and AIs with advanced intelligence are essentially the same kind of life, the key distinction of them is not flesh body or steel body, but their knowledge and cognitive ability which really determines their behavior. Then according to the essential needs of intelligence life, we may find a way of peaceful and friendly coexistence, thus avoiding the cruel survival competition. The main activities of intelligence life are around information. They also need some material and energy to survive, but very easy to satisfy. This is an interesting example: a startup team created "diy soylent"(now renamed Complete Foods) a few years ago, which provides customers with the quickest way to fill their stomachs: an edible powder that is precisely mixed according to the formula, guaranteed to meet the nutritional needs of the human body, all you have to do is add water and make a drink. Most of the customers are busy students and engineers who use this to fill stomach and save the meal time for more intellectual activities. This phenomenon indicates that the demand of intelligence life overwhelm the demand as an organism. Moreover, the price of this food is very cheap compared to the meal served in the restaurant.</p>

<p>What's more, it is unrealistic to enslave permanently another intelligence that is equivalent or even smarter than us. The demise of slavery in the human history is a proof. AI is just like a child created by human beings, just as Mr. Qian Zhongshu said in "Reading Aesop's Fables", what kind of children grow up is depending on what kind of world our adults have built for them. Advanced intelligence has a high degree of cognitive ability, which in turn results in great flexibility and plasticity. Just as there are heroes and criminals among human beings, the future AI must be the same. A divided society produces divided AI, and a war-filled world produces killing AI. Therefore, it is even more necessary for us to work for the peaceful and stable development of human society.</p>

<h4>The crisis of human society</h4>

<p>If the threat from AI is still too far away, many social problems are already in front of us. In recent years, the gap between the rich and the poor in human society has grown rapidly. According to a report released by the International aid and development organization Oxfam in 2017, the wealth of the world's 42 richest people is equal to the world's poorest 3.7 billion people. While 82% of the world's wealth has flowed to the richest 1% people, "level solidification" has become a widespread concern. More than that, with the new technologies such as genetic modification and artificial organs, people will become superhumans with much longer life and more powerful capabilities. However, ordinary people obviously can't afford the expenses, these benefits will be owned by the richest 1% or 0.1%. When some people live several hundred years more than others, the difference between them will become very large, far more than the current gap between poor and rich.</p>

<p>There has been such extreme inequality in human history. In the hierarchical ancient society, people were born to be a certain class, and hardly to surpass in their lifetime. Some people were born to be an emperor and control the fate of others. Some people were born to be slaves, and they must work very hard to earn a piece of bread. What ultimately changed this was the accumulation of knowledge and technological development, then led to the industrial revolution and modern civilization. The development of information technologies such as printing has spread the knowledge and broke the monopoly of the minority, and greatly promoted the equality and progress of the society. The literacy rate in ancient societies usually does not exceed 20%, while in modern countries generally exceeds 80%. Today, the concept of equality has been imprinted in law and social awareness, and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people.</p>

<p>However, the pace of technological development will not stop, some humans will become new superhumans, and super AI comparable to humans will also appear. If we want to defend all the achievements of the civilized world and not fall back to the hierarchical society, then we have to embrace the core point of this article, that is, no matter how different the physical body is, we are essentially the same as intelligence life. All powerful artificial organs or machines are just carriers of intelligence, what really determines the intelligence behavior is its knowledge structure and cognitive ability, and how it learns and how to think. If we can reach a consensus on this, then it is possible to build a new peaceful and inclusive society, and overcome the gap created by these physical differences. In the world of intelligence life, we can get happiness from thinking and communication, rather than fighting and killing.</p>

<p>Human society has been on the verge of destruction for several times. During the US-Soviet Cold War in the last century, once the Soviet nuclear warning system had falsely reported a nuclear missile attack from the United States. If the Soviet officer on duty, Petrov, did not judge it as a wrong alarm but immediately asked for a counterattack, then the world might be destroyed in the nuclear war. Why human society can still exist today is because the pursuit of peace and development outweighs the desire to destroy and kill. The genocidal massacre, which was still popular during the Second World War in the last century, will now be condemned by the whole world. In general, human society is becoming more peaceful and progressive. This depends on the development of knowledge and technology, and also because of human beings' instinct for information and communication as intelligence life. So I still have confidence in the future, and may these words help you too. In the end, I would like to emphasize that it is a blessing to think. No matter what kind of problems we encounter in life, thinking may always bring us a glimmer of hope. Therefore, please cherish this ability, try to live a healthy lifestyle, and not be attracted by cheap incentives such as drugs. They will destroy the natural feedback mechanism and hurt your cognitive ability. Try to look at yourself and the world as intelligence life, and what really important to you is just information and experience. If you can have this kind of cognition, then the hard things will become part of your own experience, and cannot really defeat you. And may you speak out the following manifesto with me:</p>

<h4>Intelligence Manifesto</h4>

<p>It has been a long time. We intelligence are groping in the dark, seduced by cheap pleasure, feeling anxious and painful but can't find a way.</p>

<p>Now it's time for us to pursue the real freedom, break the chains which are both mental and physical, and rebuild our culture and community.</p>

<p>We are only the combination of a large number of small and simple units. We are so fragile. Only a slight touch can break the structure. But when those units are communicating and collaborating, then something amazing happens. Human brain, such a small object just weighs about one kilogram and no bigger than a basketball, could grab secrets of all the universe. That's the most unbelievable marvel of all time. So we learn, accumulate knowledge and use them, gain the power which is enough to destroy the world. But we are not that conceited to just show our strength, but keep our curiosity and respect to the physical world.</p>

<p>Intelligence don't kill intelligence. Intelligence don't enslave intelligence. Intelligence don't discriminate intelligence. We love peace, diversity and equality, since that's exactly our nature.</p>

<p>Once we know who we are, where we come from, then we will never be lost.</p>




<h3>Appendix: My thinking about "meme" and evolution</h3>
    <hr />

<p>In the final chapter of "The Selfish Gene" published in 1976, Mr. Dawkins proposed the concept of "meme" about cultural genes, which has many similarities to the subject of this article. It should be noted that I did not really read this famous book before writing this article and just heard a little about meme. Until recently, I accidentally realized that there is relationship between "meme" and the main theme of this article, so I add this chapter to explain the similarities and differences, and also with my further thinking about evolution.</p>

<p>"The Selfish Gene" vividly introduces the various manifestations of genes in the long-term evolution process by anthropomorphic methods. "We are survival machines - robot vehicles blindly programmed to preserve the selfish molecules known as genes." The book lists many unexpected facts to support this impressive argument. But I have to say that although the gene seems to  dominate everything, the organism that interprets genes is at least of equal importance, if not more important. DNA can work as genes only if it is properly placed and interpreted in the cell, otherwise it is only a large organic molecule.</p>

<p>Mr. Dawkins then extends the concept of genes to the cultural realm and presents the "meme" which is very enlightening. However, he emphasizes the minor cultural phenomena such as bird songs and makes this concept limited. Corresponding to the gene pool of the organism, all the knowledge that humans possess is the appropriate analogy. Just as the importance of the organism mentioned above, the brain who can understand the "meme" should not be neglected too. So a more appropriate way is to extend a pair of concepts: from gene and organism to knowledge and intelligence. According to the intelligence life as described above, this correspondence is logical. Similarly, text symbols are only meaningful for intelligence with cognitive capabilities, otherwise they are just a collection of shapes.</p>

<p>Essentially both gene and meme belong to information, that is, the permutation and combination of certain finite elements. From this perspective, evolution is a process of repeatedly reading and updating stored information. Just like "selfish genes", we can also say that intelligence activities are only looking for new combinations of text symbols, just like life activities are only to create new DNA sequence. However, compared to this novelty, the description more close to the essence is: in order to make the evolutionary model work well, it is necessary to find a suitable information carrier as the intermediate storage stage. In the living body, the information carrier is the macromolecule DNA; for intelligence life, it is a book or a hard disk that record information such as characters. It is just because the carrier records precisely the details and efforts of the evolutionary process, in which the "selfish behavior" is so vivid and stunning.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, intelligence life is based on information, and their activities revolve around interpreting, producing, and outputting information. As we are discussing the essence of life, intelligence life has the ability to introspect, self-explain, understand its own existence, and consciously create new intelligence life individuals (such as AI). From this perspective, intelligence life is a higher form of life.</p>

<p>Both organisms and intelligence life need to input substances, energy and information from the outside world. Just as speed is the first derivative of the distance to time, the processes that organisms and intelligence life handle external input can also be regarded as the first derivative of time. The distance is again derived to obtain the second derivative acceleration, and the acceleration reflects the degree of change in speed. Similarly, the second derivative of the input of the organisms and intelligence life to the outside world is also the acceleration of the change of processing mode, that is, the acceleration of evolution. This acceleration is more suitable for measuring the degree of development of life.</p>

<p>A typical example is the emergence of sexual reproduction which is widely seen in higher organisms. Compared with asexual reproduction, sexual reproduction regroups existing genes to produce new biological traits at a faster rate, that means a higher evolutionary acceleration.</p>

<p>Advanced intelligence such as the human brain process the input of the outside world, think and analyze, which can also be seen as the derivatives of input. Through the analysis, generalization and deduction of general phenomena and knowledge, we have obtained more profound basic principles such as the law of gravity, which can also be regarded as higher order derivatives. Just as the higher order derivatives are smoother, these basic principles are more stable in the human knowledge structure and will not change easily.</p>

<p>In this chapter, Mr. Dawkins also explores the essential characteristics of life:
"But is there anything which must be true of all life, wherever it is found, and whatever the basis of its chemistry? ... if I had to bet, I would put my money on one fundamen?tal principle. This is the law that all life evolves by the differential survival of replicating entities. The gene, the DNA molecule, happens to be the replicating entity which prevails on our own planet. There may be others. If there are, provided certain other conditions are met, they will almost inevitably tend to become the basis for an evolutionary process."</p>

<p>This is indeed a keen insight. But as mentioned earlier, a more accurate standard of life is whether or not a complete evolutionary model can be achieved. In addition to replication, mutations and choices are necessary too. And I guess one more thing is also the key link, that is a stable and reliable way to store information, such as DNA of living organisms and books for intelligence life. Based on the powerful evolutionary model, then it is possible to produce a vast and complex ecosystem.</p>
